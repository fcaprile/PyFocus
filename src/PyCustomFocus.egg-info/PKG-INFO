This is PyFocus, a Python package that provides high-level functions and an user interface to perform full vectorial calculations of the focus of an electromagnetic field that has been modulated by a custom phase mask, while providing the option of simulating the free propagation of these fields under the paraxial approximation and the focus through an interface or a multilayer system.

You can find detailed information about the theorical calculations used in this package and a full description of many common use cases in the following paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2022.108315. If use this package for your research, please cite this work.

For a quick windows executable program, download and run "PyFocus.exe"
